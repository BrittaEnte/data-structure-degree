task zero
big o notation O(1) 
each line in the csv file will be called 1 time.


task one
big o notation O(n)
each number will be called once and put into the new set. 


task two
big o notation sorting is O(n log n) and we are sorting 
inside loops. so O 2(n log n)


task three
O(n* nlogn), because i am sorting all the calls into tow different types. one type are the calls with 080 as number and the other are 140 as telemarkers.

task four
the sorted method run O(n log n). all our for loops will run with O(n)
